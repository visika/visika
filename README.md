I'm studying physics at Federico II in Naples, Italy.
My interests are programming (I explored functional programming like Clojure in the pandemy), linux (currently using Arch Linux, the best experience I've found so far), aikido, 3d printing.

I'm currently studying for the quantum mechanics exam at university, it's a beast.

I'm part of the [PONYS](http://www.ponys.unina.it/) students association,
a group of passionate and competent students promoting science.
I'm currently working with them to bring [Entanglion](https://entanglion.github.io/),
a quantum mechanics inspired board game, to our next events.
You will find us around April and May of this year in Naples!

## University

I worked for one year on quantum computing, writing my undergraduate thesis, during which I wrote some scripts to implement a quantum perceptron ([Tacchino et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02266.pdf)) and a distance-based classifier ([Schuld et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10793.pdf)).

- **[Quantum Perceptron](https://github.com/visika/quantum-perceptron)** A simple implementation that built my intuition around quantum circuits.
- **[Distance-based classifier](https://github.com/visika/Tesi)** A messy folder with the files I used for my thesis; I started with the instructions from the article and then improved it myself to use more vectors, more features (with QRAM, see [Petruccione et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02362)) and making it a multiclass calssifier.

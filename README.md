I studied Physics at Federico II University in Naples, Italy.
My interests are programming (I explored functional programming like Clojure in the pandemy), linux (currently using EndeavourOS and NixOS), aikido, 3D printing.

I'm currently working as IT Manager and Quality Manager at the engineering firm Sintech Solution.

I'm part of the [PONYS](http://www.ponys.unina.it/) students association,
a group of passionate and competent students promoting science.
I'm currently working with them to bring [Entanglion](https://entanglion.github.io/),
a quantum mechanics inspired board game, to our next events.
You will find us around April and May of this year in Naples!

## University

### Master's Degree in Theoretical Physics: Thesis on Molecular Dynamics simulation using Graph Neural Networks

In my [Master's Degree project](https://github.com/visika/tesi-magistrale)
I analyzed thermodynamic properties of solid and liquid water,
using MACE, a state of the art machine learning potential.

During my study path I acquired an in-depth understanding of numerical simulation algorithms and techniques,
advanced training in thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning methods.

### Bachelor's Degree in Physics: Thesis on Quantum Computing

In my undergraduate thesis project
I implemented a quantum perceptron ([Tacchino et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02266.pdf))
and a distance-based classifier ([Schuld et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10793.pdf))
on IBM quantum computers using QASM and Qiskit.

- **[Quantum Perceptron](https://github.com/visika/quantum-perceptron)** A simple implementation that built my intuition around quantum circuits.
- **[Distance-based classifier](https://github.com/visika/Tesi)** A messy folder with the files I used for my thesis;
  I started with the instructions from the article and then improved it myself to use more vectors,
  more features (with QRAM, see [Petruccione et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02362)) and making it a multiclass calssifier.

I learned advanced concepts in mathematics, gained proficiency in physics, and with the scientific method;
this included laboratory measurements and data analysis skills, accompanied by strong programming abilities and attitude to work in group.

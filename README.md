### Thesis in Quantum Computing

I worked for one year on Quantum Computing, writing my undergraduate thesis. I wrote some scripts to implement a quantum perceptron ([Tacchino et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.02266.pdf)) and a distance-based classifier ([Schuld et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10793.pdf)).

- **[Quantum Perceptron](https://github.com/visika/quantum-perceptron)** A simple implementation that built my intuition around quantum circuits.
- **[Distance-based classifier](https://github.com/visika/Tesi)** A messy folder with the files I used for my thesis; I started with the instructions from the article and then improved it myself to use more vectors, more features (with QRAM, see [Petruccione et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02362)) and making it a multiclass calssifier.
